# ü´Å Lung Disease Risk Predictor using Machine Learning

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the **risk of lung disease** based on various medical and lifestyle-related input parameters. The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier on a curated dataset and provides a user-friendly interface for risk evaluation.


##  How it Works

The app accepts input from users for 19 parameters like:
- Age, Gender, BMI
- Medical history (Heart Failure, Smoking, Vaccination, Depression, etc.)
- Respiratory metrics (FEV1, MMRC, Oxygen Saturation, etc.)

These inputs are passed to a pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier** which returns a prediction on whether the user is at **risk of developing lung disease**.
